Release cycle
   A release cycle is the life cycle of developing, testing,
   and deploying a product update or a new feature into production.

Sprint cycle
   Scrum sprint cycle is a timeboxed period when a team delivers a set amount of work. 
  It is typically two to four weeks in duration and each sprint starts the moment the previous one is completed.

Sprint happen
  If a Sprint traditionally takes 1-2 weeks to complete, then a retrospective should be held every 7-14 days.

Retrospective 
   A sprint retrospective is a type of meeting within the Agile framework that happens at the end of a sprint.
   A sprint retrospective gives you an opportunity to review your latest sprint 
  and make improvements for future sprints. These meetings are essential because
  regularly assessing and improving processes leads to quality results and fewer obstacles.

Retrospective meeting
  
   The retrospective meeting follows a specific agenda or format, which may include activities such as
 reviewing the previous iteration's goals, discussing successes and challenges, identifying areas for improvement,
 and deciding on action items for the next iteration.
