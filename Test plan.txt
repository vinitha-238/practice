 TEST PLAN
  A test plan is a detailed document which describes software testing areas and activities.
  It outlines the test strategy, objectives, test schedule,
 required resources (human resources, software, and hardware), test estimation and test deliverables.

Follow these six steps to create an efficient test plan:

1.Define the release scope
      to understand the scope of the project
 
2. Schedule timelines 
      to help you decide your testing time and routine.
3. Define test objectives
      reason or purpose for designing and executing a test to guide testing process
4.Determine test deliverables
      The products of testing that help track testing progress.
     Deliverables should meet your project’s and client’s needs

  Before testing
    Test plan document
    Test suite
    Test design and environment specifications
  During testing
   Test log
   Defect report
   Test data
   Test summary report
 After testing
  Test completion report
  User acceptance test (UAT) report
  Release notes

5.Design the test strategy
     determine test cost, test effort, and which features will be in-scope
6.Plan test environment and test data 
     The test environment includes hardware, software, and network configurations for software testing.
